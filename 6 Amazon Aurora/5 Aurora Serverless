Aurora Serverless
=================

    - Built on same foundation of Amazon Aurora
    - MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility

    Align Aurora with Serverless model

        - Dont think about instances
        - Pay only for what you use

    how?

        - Aurora Storage optimization
        - Decouples the DB host from the application



How does it work?

    - VPC
    - Aurora Serverless in another VPC
    - Connect them both using VPC Endpoints


Capacity Management:
=====================

    - No more DB Instance classes
    - Aurora Compute Unit (ACU)
    - ACU provides an amount of memory and CPU
    - Set Min and Max amount of ACU for your DB

Aurora Serverless will automatically scale as needed:
=====================================================

    - CPU and Connections Scaling Rules
    - Can automatically scale down to 0 when inactive
    - Manual scaling is available
