Key Concepts
============

- Aurora DB Cluster

    - 1 or more DB instance and a cluster volume
    - 2 types of DB instance

        - Primary - Read/write
        - Aurora Replica- only Read

- Aurora DB Connections

    - DB Connections through endpoints
    - Several types of Aurora endpoints

        - Cluster Endpoint - Connects to current Primary DB instance - Write Ops
        - Reader Endpoint - Connects to Replica - Read Ops  - One Reader endpoints per cluster

            - Load balacing for Read only connections to the DB

        - Custom Endpoint - set of DB instances that you choose
                          - When you connect to the endpoint, Aurora performs Load balacing and choose one the instances in the group to handle the connection

        - Instance Endpoint 


    Aurora Global Databases:
    =========================

        - Primary Region - Read & Write 
        - Secondary Region - Read Only (1 second and use dedicated infra)

        In case of failover
            - Secondary Region can be promoted
