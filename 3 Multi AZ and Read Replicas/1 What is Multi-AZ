What is Multi-AZ?
==================

* Multi Availability Zones ( High Availability)
* Isolated distinct DC
* Enterprise grade fault tolerant solution.
    - Leverage another AZ for secondary host
    - Primary host is replicated to secondary host

* Secondary host will not improve the performance of the DB
* Secondary Host does not handle active write traffic
* Used for failover scenarios
* Writes to Multi-AZ DB are slightly slower.

* Twice the cost of Single AZ config\
* Improves backups
